- Notes:

    Polls & Quizzes
    Adding a polls and quizzes section to your high school reunion website is one hack in knowing your audience. It is an effective step in knowing what they think about the reunion you are planning. In this section, you can post polls about the venue that they would like to go to, the type of food they prefer, the reunion theme, the full schedule of the event, and other ideas that can help you achieve the best program.

    Questions to ask (Multiple choice answers only) are:

     - What type of hotel should be block rooms at? 2 Star ($100+), 3 Star ($150+), or 4 Star ($200+)
     - What should be the theme for this class reunion?
     - Of these four, what activity would most interest you for Sunday morning?
     - Which would you prefer? A big banquet dinner or a BBQ lunch on Saturday?
     - Which one of the following teachers/professors would you like to meet at the class reunion?
     - Interactive Agenda Where User Can Order Events
     - Recruit a reunion committee

    Ask new questions every week, those that answer are put into a raffle for a free hotel room (use one of the free hotel rooms as part of the room block so it does not cost anything). http://grouptravel.org/class-reunion/how-to-get-a-free-room-when-booking-a-hotel-for-a-class-reunion/

    FAQS Section
    After gathering the answers from your surveys and polls, posting them in the Frequently Asked Questions or FAQS section is also one smart move. This section is one of the most visited on any type of website. Viewers love to look into it to know important details about the website if they feel too shy to ask the website owner directly. To make your high school reunion website more informative, include a FAQS section in the class reunion website template. Not only can it make your high school reunion website functional, but it also saves you time from answering a bunch of identical questions.

    Accept Donations
    Whether you like it or not, donations are a necessary part of any class reunion. In order to be able to do everything that you want to do and still keep things affordable, you are going to have to raise money by fundraising and donations.
    Dedicate a page on the website with an image of a thermometer that shows how much you need in donations from your classmates. Folks that have done well for themselves will be happy to chip in.

    Reunion Tickets
    Reunion tickets aren’t just tickets. For others who are attending the reunion event, it could be a remembrance of another memorable night. Selling reunion tickets on your high school reunion website is another hack in making your event quickly, especially nowadays where physical transactions are hard to do. You don’t have to worry because there is an answer to that.

    Blogs
    Reunion blogs can make your high school reunion website more meaningful. You can create a simple blog section on your class reunions website and allow everyone to take a look at it. You can post blogs about your personal stories from your high school days, the most memorable school events you’ve had, stories/testimonials from your past professors, and other experiences which any alumni who visit your high school reunion can relate to. You can even design the blog section wherein your audience can post their own stories, give feedback, and post suggestions. Give them the nostalgic feeling and entice them to attend the reunion.

    Keep things interactive by providing your classmates with regular updates (weekly) from the front lines. Give them insider details of how things are going, ask for advice, and send out a call for volunteers.

    Put a gallery
    One of the best things about photos and videos is that no matter how long it has been, it doesn’t change the memory. Making a gallery of your high school reunion on your class reunions website is one smart way of letting all the memories live. 
    Make sure the class reunion website allows you the ability to post photos and videos easily. Ask your classmates to submit their “then and now” photos and videos to share with the rest of the class. Use these photos online and at the class reunion as part of a slideshow.
    The photos and video pages are one of the first pages that classmates gravitate to when they get to the class reunion website. They want to see if they know anyone by face. Also, the more pictures and videos you have on the website, the more comfortable others will feel adding theirs.
    Start by getting your volunteers, and reunion planning committee members to submit their photos and videos first and then watch other classmates do the same.

    Message Board/Chat
    In order to facilitate conversation, make sure you have a message board and a chat feature set up as part of the class reunion website. As people register for the class reunion, they will be able to join others and catch up ahead of the class reunion.
    If you do add the message board feature, then we have one piece of advice for you. You need to have a volunteer watch over it on a daily basis.
    This person should be there to start conversations, engage classmates in discussion, answer questions about the class reunion, and defuse any disagreements online. Without someone engaging classmates regularly, the message boards will be empty.

    Best way to collect payments for class reunion
    One important factor you will encounter once you start planning your high school reunion website is what mode of payment you should use in collecting payments for all the expenses. As the headmaster of the event, you have to strategize a way where paying would be easily done and convenient for everyone who will join the reunion.

    There are tons of ways on how you can collect funds and payment for class reunion. Among them are the following:

    Sell tickets on your high school reunion website
    Sell 'Class of 2003' Swag to help pay for the events
    Start a donation drive
    Conduct Online Raffles

    Reunion Agenda/ Hotel Details
    Lastly, make sure you have the class reunion agenda posted with all the relevant details like time, address, and dates.
    Also, make sure to add details of where you blocked hotel rooms for the class reunion. Provide the room rate (Did you get Group Hotel Rates?), reservation telephone number, and address of the hotel.

User should be able to:
- RSVP
- Submit Photos and Videos for main gallery
- Volunteer Signup 
- Weekly Newsletter Signup
- View Event Agenda
- View Attendance Page
